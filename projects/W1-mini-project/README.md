## Project Description
In this project, you will create your first software!
You are tasked with creating a **game** that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources you have learned during the week. Your game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output. 

## Games
You must choose one of the following:

* Guess The Number

    One player chooses a number, the other must guess. After each guess, it will tell you if higher or lower so you can guess again. Both computer guesses or player guesses modes must be available. Who will be faster in guessing? What strategy will you program the computer to use? 0Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì9Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì7Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì4Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì8Ô∏è‚É£‚ùì
* Hangman

    From a collection of words, computer will choose one and user must guess. You can have a lot of fun drawing a stick man with text. üòâ  You surely know how the classic game goes.
        
    ```
        ‚îå----‚îê
        |    O
        |   /|\
        |   / \
        ‚î¥            I _ o n _ a c k
    ```
* Tic Tac Toe
        
    The classic of the classics, a great pass time. How will the computer fare? Can you think of someway to program it to strategize?  ü§î 

* Blackjack
        
    You vs the computer. How will you keep track of all the cards that have been delt and which are left on the deck? ‚ô†Ô∏èüÉè

* Strong Random Password Generator

    Not just random letters, it must be secure! And the user should have some say on it. How many characters? Any character not allowed? Should all characters have the same probability of being chosen? Also, can you [brute force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) it? üíª

* Message Encryption & Decryption

    Program must have a encrypting and a decrypting mode. You may investigate and chose encryption mode and algorithm you prefer. Will it be a cypher? Will both users have the same key? Your own enigma machine.... üîê

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Create your own git repository. 
* Build your own code from scratch. 
* Put into practice the basic python concepts learned during the week.
* Have fun!

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are: 
* Your repository must be clean and organized, which means that it must include a [*.gitignore*](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file) file and a [README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) file, as well as have a well-structured file organization. 
* Your code must include functions. 

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must turn in are:
* You should open an issue on the labs repo of your bootcamp and provide the link for your repository with your work. The repository must include all the files you used to build your game. Remember to commit often!

## Advices
- Organize and plan ahead! Try and figure out how you want your program to work and draw a structure or skelleton of it before filling it all with code.
- Turn one big task into several small tasks! Little tasks are easier to figure out and overcome.
- Keep it clean. If you follow the conventions and make things as structured as posible from the get-go, you won't have to refactor, patch and clean after yourself aftewards.
- Keep it simple! Each function should have a single purpose and better be pure. It is easier to control the flow if you have only a few things to account for each time. Remember that functions give you the capacity to abstract from extracts of code, just plug and play.

## Documentation
Document your code!!! Think of all the work you put into it, give it proper clothing, make it shine so everyone can see and understand it.

## Reflection
* Write a small description of your game and your process
* What were some of the challenges ?
* What did I learn? 
* If I were to start from scratch, what would I do differently and what would I keep the same?
* Improvements for the future
* Highlights, things you are very proud of.

Tip: HAVE A GREAT TIME! Keep on coding. üòÅ
