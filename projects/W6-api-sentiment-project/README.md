**Description:** You've been web-scrapping and querying databases for data. Now **you** will be the data provider üéâ.

For that, you will create your own API. This API will be able to receive information, store it, or serve it when needed.

In this project, you will practice:

- Flask (API creation)
- MongoDB 
- NLTK (sentiment analysis)

## Project Goals 
**Main goal**: Create an API that:
 1. Serves information to clients (in response to their GET requests).
 2. Receives data from your clients (via their POST requests) and saves it to your own database.

Remember, YOU (your API) are the server, and clients send GET or POST requests to you.

- (L0ü§î) Design the **structure** of your own database depending on the type of info you want to store.
- (L1üßê) Write an API using flask to receive chat messages and **store** them in a database like mongodb or mysql.
- (L2ü•≥) **Read** and serve data from the chats database using different endpoints.
- (L3ü§≠) Extract the **emotional value** of messages per user/chats and make it _queryable_ through an endpoit.
- (L4üî•) Do it real, use slack API to get messages and analyze the messages of our `datamad1020` channel.
  - `https://api.slack.com/`

## Example's - API Endpoints 


### 1. Endpoints GET

- (GET) `/users`
Returns every user in the database.

- (GET) `/messages`
Returns every message sent in every chat.

- (GET) `/<chat_name>/<user>`
Returns every message sent in a given chat.

### 2. Endpoint POST

- (POST) `/chat/<chat_id>`
Creates a chat

- (POST) `/chat/<chat_id>/adduser`
Adds a user to a chat.

- (POST) `/chat/<chat_id>/message`
Adds a message from a user to a given chat.
